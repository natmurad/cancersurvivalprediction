# :stethoscope: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dataset (HCC dataset) Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

The dataset used here was collected at a University Hospital in Portugal. It contains real clinical data of 165 patients diagnosed with HCC. It was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mrsantos/hcc-dataset). The goal is to predict if a person will survive or not one year after the diagnosis. It contains several information like symptons, alcohol, hepatitis, metastasis, gender, cirrhosis and etc. The main challenges on this dataset are the unballanced classes, high number of missing data and small sample.
